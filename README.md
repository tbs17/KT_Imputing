# Imputing Knowledge Tracing Data with Subject-Based Training via LSTM Variational Autoencoders Frameworks
This code is a result of the paper `Imputing Knowledge Tracing Data with Subject-Based Training via LSTM Variational Autoencoders Frameworks' published in AI4ED workshop of AAAI2023.

This code base heavily relies on the git repo: https://github.com/Khamies/LSTM-Variational-AutoEncoder.git except for data_process/generalize_kt/kt_utils/mv_nn/train_test_mv.py. If you have any question reagarding LVAE structure, you can always refer to the original repo: https://github.com/Khamies/LSTM-Variational-AutoEncoder.git.
